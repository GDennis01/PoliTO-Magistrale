#### User interface
User may query the **DW** by using:
- **controlled query enviroment**
- **pre-defined query** and **report generation tools**
- **data mining tools**

## OLAP Analysis
#### Roll up
Data detail reduction by decreasing detail in a dimension, by climbing up a hiearchy
e.g. : *group by store,month* $\rightarrow$ group by city,month
or dropping a whole dimension(not physically)
#### Drill down
Data detail increase by increasing detail in a dimension by walking down a hierarchy
e.g. : *group by city,month* $\rightarrow$ *group by store,month*
or adding a whole dimension(not physically).
It's the opposite of the roll up operation.
Often used on a subset of data produced by the initial query in order to focus more on certain aspects.
#### Slice and dice
Selection of a data subset by means of a selection predicate:
- **Slice:** equality predicate selecting a *slice*(una fetta praticamente)
- **Dice:** predicate expression selecting a *dice*(un ipercubo pi√π piccolino).
#### Pivot
Rearrengement of the multidimensional structure without changing the detail level. Useful to make the information more redeable.

## Extended SQL Language
New **OLAP** functions characterized by a new **computation window** which inside aggregation functions are performed.
Also new aggregate functions are added.

#### Computation window
A moving **window** clause characterized by
- **partitioning:** rows are grouped without collapsing them(unlike group by)
- **row ordering** separately in each partition(like order by)
- **aggregation window:** for each row in the partition, it defines the row group on which the aggregate function is computed
#### Example
![[example.png]]
![[example_table.png]]
![[esql_exa.png]]
*Cyan part: we compute the average **over** a moving window defined in the brackets. This window is defined as follows: partitioned by city, ordered by month and contains the current row + 2 preceding rows*


### Computation Window
It can be defined with 2 different approaches:
- **physical level:** builds the group by *counting rows*
- **logical level:** builds the group by defining an interval on the sort key

#### Physical interval definition
- Can be defined between a lower bound and the current row:
  **ROWS 2 PRECEDING**  $\rightarrow$ aggregation window of size 3: current row + 2 preceding rows, it may be incomplete and has a fixed size
- Can be defined between lower and upper bounds:
  **ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING** $\rightarrow$ aggregation window of size 3: current row + preceding row + following row.
  **ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING** $\rightarrow$ same as above but with 2 more rows.
- Between the beginning(or the end) of a partition and the current row
  **ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING(o FOLLOWING)** $\rightarrow$ current row + all preceding/following rows

This approach is mostly used when there are no gaps in the data(every month is present in the dataset).

#### Logical interval definition
For this kind of approach we use the **RANGE** keyword
It's appropriate for sparse data.
Unlike the physical definition, here we can only specify a single sort key(in physical the rows are ordered according to the **ORDER BY** clause)

#### Group By
Aggregation windows can be used with a **GROUP BY** clause.
The temporary table generated by the GROUP BY clause it's the element where the aggregation window performs the computation

#### Ranking functions
New aggregating functions that compute rank of a value inside a partition
- **rank():** computes the rank by leaving an empty slot after a tie 
  example: after 2 first, the next rank is third
- **denserank():** computes the rank by leaving an empty slot after a tie
  example: after 2 first, the next rank is second

#### Order By
The **ORDER BY** clause inside a partition doesn't affect how the end result is visualized.
It's purpose is to order the data inside a partition to perform a specific computation.


#### Group By Extension
- **rollup:**
- **cube:**
- **grouping sets**
