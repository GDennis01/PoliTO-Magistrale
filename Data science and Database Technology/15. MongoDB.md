If we had to make an analogy with Relation database:
- **Tables** are called **Collections**
- **Records** are called **Documents**
- **Columns** are called **Fields**.

Documents are stored into **BSON** file, a binary representation of JSON.

### Field Names
The field name **\_id** is a reserved keyword used for primary keys.
By default has a unique identifier as value.
There are several rules which field names must abide and they are the classic ones, such as they cant start with a number etc.

### Database
Each instance of MongoDB can manage multiple databases and each database is composed of a set of collections.
To show the list of available databases: **show databases**
and then to select one: **use \<database-name\>**
Instead, to drop a selected database: db.dropDatabase().

### CRUD Operations

#### Create
![[create_mongodb.png]]
![[create_nested_doc_mongodb.png]]
*Here, \_id is implicit*

If we want to instead insert many documents all at once, we can use **insertMany** and provide it an array of documents
#### Delete
![[delete_mongodb.png]]
*The argument can be optional*

#### Query Language
![[find_mongodb.png]]
The **find** method has 2 parameters:
- **conditions**
- **fields** we want 
![[find2_mongodb.png]]
To select a particular field, we must explicitly write in the second parameter.
**1** means the field is included, **0** is excluded.
The **id** field is automatically included.

#### Joins
There are no joins in MongoDB.
Get good at building nested documents to achieve something similar to a join!

### Conditions
![[comparison_mongodb.png]]To use these operators, the following syntas is used:
![[comp2_mongdb.png]]

To chain different conditions, by either AND or OR:
- **AND:**![[and_mongodb.png]]
- **OR:** ![[or_mongodb.png]]
### Cursor
**db.collection.find()** return a **cursor** that lets you iterate over the result or use it as input for next operations(such as **sort()** etc).

### Update
![[update_many.png]]
This code **updates** **inventory** where $\text{qty} \lt 50$ and set **size.uom** to **"in"** and status to **P**.
Current date is a function to retrieve the date.
If the size.uom field doesnt exist, it will be created and set to the provided value.
The **\$inc** operated can be used to increment a value instead of **\$set**

### Pipeline

### Index
Without indexes, MongoDB perform a collection scan(akin to Full table scan in a RDBMS).
Thus indexes are important to improve the performance.
By default, MongoDB creates a **unique index** on the **\_id** field that cannot be removed.
