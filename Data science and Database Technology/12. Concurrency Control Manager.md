## Introduction
The workload of operational DBMSs is measured in term of **tps**, transactions per second.
In a banking scenario, a typical tps would be around $10^3$, which is quite a lot.
Thus, a concurrency control manager is needed, to manage all concurrent access to data.

Elementary **I/O** operations are:
- **read** of a single data object **x** - $r(x)$ 
- **write** of a single data object **x** - $r(x)$ 

The **scheduler** is a block of the concurrency control manager in charge of deciding if and when read/write can be satisfied.
Without a scheduler there would be anomalies in data.

## Anomalies
### Lost update
Happens when two transactions read the same value but commit at different time.
In the following image, the correct value would be $x=4$, however due to the fact that $T_2$ read an incorrect value of $x$, the final value of $x$ is $3$ instead of $4$

*bot stands for beginning of transaction*

### Dirty read
$T_2$ reads the value of X in an intermediate state which is not stable.
In this case, the system forces $T_2$ to *cascade rollback*.
It's called **dirty read** as $T_2$ reads a value not stable, dirty.

### Inconsistent read
Happends when a transaction reads the same value twice, but the second time it reads a different value, thus an *inconsistent read*.

### Ghost update - type A
As the name implies, a transaction is not able to see changes performed on a certain object.
![[ghost_update_a.png]]
Here, $T_1$ doesn't detect an update in $y$. The correct value would be $1000$ 
### Ghost update - type B
Happens when new objects are inserted in table while a transaction is still running.
![[ghost_update_b.png]]
It's a sort of *inconsistent read* due to new records inserted by $T_2$.
Here the **ghost update** is the *insertion*

## Concurrency Control
Let's start by defining a **transaction:**
A **transaction** is a sequence of **read/write** operations characterized by the **same** **TID**. E.g: $r_1(x)r_1(y)w_1(x)w_1(y)$ 
A **schedule** is a sequence of **read/write** operations performed by **concurrent** **transactions**. E.g:$r_1(z)r_2(z)w_1(y)w_2(z)$
The **scheduler** is in charge of **aborting/committing** transactions based on these sequences.

### Commit projection
A technique based on the assumption that **transactions end with a commit(not abort)**.
Covers every anomalies but **dirty read** due to the fact that this anomaly is provoked by an **abort**.
Also **ghost update type B** cannot be covered as it needs a locking mechanism to be prevented.

#### Serial schedule
In a **serial schedule**, transactions are not interleaved and they appear in sequence.

*Example of a serial schedule*

Quite intuitively, a serial schedule never causes an anomaly.
Thus, a **schedule** is **correct** if it's **serializable**, that is, if it's equivalent to its **serial** version.

#### Equivalence between schedules
There are several **equivalence classes** between two classes.
Each class detects a set of acceptable schedules.

#### View equivalence
Let's define first these two relations
- **reads-from:** $r_1(x)$ reads-from $w_j(x)$  when:
	- $w_j(x)$ precedes $r_i(x)$ and $i\ne j$ 
	- there is no other $w_k(x)$ between them
- **final write:** $w_i$ is a final write if it is the last write of $x$ appearing in the schedule
Now, two schedules are said to be **view-equivalent** if they have the same **reads-from** set and **final write** set

##### View serializable schedule - VSR
A schedule is **view serializable** if it is view equivalent to another arbitrary **serial** schedule of the same transactions.
![[view_equiv_ex.png]]
Here $S_1$ is **view serializable** since it's **view equivalent** to $S_2$.
The arrows represent the *reads from* relation while the **underlining** represent the *final write* relation.

To declare a **schedule** as **incorrect**, one must explore every **serial schedule** to check the **view equivalence**!!
For example, a **schedule** $S$ may not be **view equivalent** to the serial schedule $S_1$ but may be equivalent to serial schedule $S_2$.
In this case $S$ would still be correct.
##### Complexity
**Given** a serial schedule, detecting the view equivalence has a linear complexity.
However detecting view equivalence to any **arbitrary** serial schedule is **NP** and thus infeasible

#### Conflict equivalence
