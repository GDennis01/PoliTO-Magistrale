## Introduction
The workload of operational DBMSs is measured in term of **tps**, transactions per second.
In a banking scenario, a typical tps would be around $10^3$, which is quite a lot.
Thus, a concurrency control manager is needed, to manage all concurrent access to data.

Elementary **I/O** operations are:
- **read** of a single data object **x** - $r(x)$ 
- **write** of a single data object **x** - $r(x)$ 

The **scheduler** is a block of the concurrency control manager in charge of deciding if and when read/write can be satisfied.
Without a scheduler there would be anomalies in data.

## Anomalies
### Lost update
Happens when two transactions read the same value but commit at different time.
In the following image, the correct value would be $x=4$, however due to the fact that $T_2$ read an incorrect value of $x$, the final value of $x$ is $3$ instead of $4$

*bot stands for beginning of transaction*

### Dirty read
$T_2$ reads the value of X in an intermediate state which is not stable.
In this case, the system forces $T_2$ to *cascade rollback*.
It's called **dirty read** as $T_2$ reads a value not stable, dirty.

### Inconsistent read
Happens when a transaction reads the same value twice, but the second time it reads a different value, thus an *inconsistent read*.
![[inconsistend_read.png]]

### Ghost update - type A
As the name implies, a transaction is not able to see changes performed on a certain object.
![[ghost_update_a.png]]
Here, $T_1$ doesn't detect an update in $y$. The correct value would be $1000$ 
### Ghost update - type B
Happens when new objects are inserted in table while a transaction is still running.
![[ghost_update_b.png]]
It's a sort of *inconsistent read* due to new records inserted by $T_2$.
Here the **ghost update** is the *insertion*

## Concurrency Control
Let's start by defining a **transaction:**
A **transaction** is a sequence of **read/write** operations characterized by the **same** **TID**. E.g: $r_1(x)r_1(y)w_1(x)w_1(y)$ 
A **schedule** is a sequence of **read/write** operations performed by **concurrent** **transactions**. E.g:$r_1(z)r_2(z)w_1(y)w_2(z)$
The **scheduler** is in charge of **aborting/committing** transactions based on these sequences.

### Commit projection
A technique based on the assumption that **transactions end with a commit(not abort)**.
Covers every anomalies but **dirty read** due to the fact that this anomaly is provoked by an **abort**.
Also **ghost update type B** cannot be covered as it needs a locking mechanism to be prevented.

#### Serial schedule
In a **serial schedule**, transactions are not interleaved and they appear in sequence.
![[serial_schedule.png]]
*Example of a serial schedule*

Quite intuitively, a serial schedule never causes an anomaly.
Thus, a **schedule** is **correct** if it's **serializable**, that is, if it's equivalent to its **serial** version.

#### Equivalence between schedules
There are several **equivalence classes** between two classes.
Each class detects a set of acceptable schedules.

#### View equivalence
Let's define first these two relations
- **reads-from:** $r_1(x)$ reads-from $w_j(x)$  when:
	- $w_j(x)$ precedes $r_i(x)$ and $i\ne j$ 
	- there is no other $w_k(x)$ between them
- **final write:** $w_i$ is a final write if it is the last write of $x$ appearing in the schedule
Now, two schedules are said to be **view-equivalent** if they have the same **reads-from** set and **final write** set

##### View serializable schedule - VSR
A schedule is **view serializable** if it is view equivalent to another arbitrary **serial** schedule of the same transactions.
![[view_equiv_ex.png]]
Here $S_1$ is **view serializable** since it's **view equivalent** to $S_2$.
The arrows represent the *reads from* relation while the **underlining** represent the *final write* relation.

To declare a **schedule** as **incorrect**, one must explore every **serial schedule** to check the **view equivalence**!!
For example, a **schedule** $S$ may not be **view equivalent** to the serial schedule $S_1$ but may be equivalent to serial schedule $S_2$.
In this case $S$ would still be correct.
##### Complexity
**Given** a serial schedule, detecting the view equivalence has a linear complexity.
However detecting view equivalence to any **arbitrary** serial schedule is **NP** and thus infeasible

#### Conflict equivalence
Let's first define what a **conflicting action** is.
Action $A_j(x)$ is in conflict with $A_i(x)$ ($i\ne j$) if:
- both **actions operate on the same object** **x**
- at least one action between $A_j$ and $A_i$ is a write(if both actions were reads, no conflict would arise)
	- **Read-write** conflicts(RW or WR)
	- **Write-write** conflicts(WW)
 - there is no other write $w_k(x)$ between $A_j(x)$ and $A_i(x)$.
 
Now, two schedules are said to be **conflict equivalent** if:
- they have the same conflict set
- each **conflict pair** is in the same order in both schedules(if we have the pair $A_1,A_2$ ,we cannot have $A_2,A_1$ in a schedule and $A_1,A_2$ in another)

A schedule is **conflict serializable**(CSR) if it's **conflict equivalent** to a serial schedule.
**CSR** schedules are a subset of **VSR** schedules

##### Example
![[conf_ser_example.png]]
Let's examine conflict pairs on **S:**
- $w_0(x),r_1(x)$ 
- $w_0(x),w_1(x)$ 
- $w_0(x),r_2(x)$
- $w_0(z),r_1(z)$ 
- $w_0(z),r_3(z)$
- $w_0(z),w_3(z)$ 
- $r_1(z),w_3(z)$ 
- $r_2(x),w_1(x)$
Now, all these pairs appear in the same order in the serial schedule $S_s$ 

##### Detecting conflict-serializability
It's possible to exploit a **conflict graph** where we have:
- a **node** for each **transaction**
- an **edge** $T_i\rightarrow T_j$ if
	- there exists at least a conflict between an action $A_i$  in $T_i$ and an action $A_j$ in $T_j$ 
	- $A_i$ precedes $A_j$ 
If the graph is **acyclic**, then the schedule is **CSR**.
Detecting if a graph is **acyclic** is linear in the size of the graph.


#### 2 Phase Locking - 2PL
##### Concept
A technique based on a locking mechanism.
Exploited by most of the commercial DBMSs
A **lock** is a block on a resource which may prevent access to others.
There are 2 **lock** operations:
- **Lock:** apply a lock on a resource
	- **Read-lock** (**R-lock**)
	- **Write-lock** (**W-lock**)
- **Unlock**: release a lock on a resource
Each **read** operation is preceded by a **R-lock** request and followed by a **unlock** request.
Same concept is applied for a **write** operation.

Characterized by two phases(hence **Two Phase Locking**):
1. **growing phase:** locks are acquired
2. **shrinking phase:** locks are released

Quite intuitively, a **read lock** on a certain resource may be **shared** among different transaction while a **write lock** is exclusive and it's not compatibile with any locks(even **read** ones) as it would cause conflicts.

A counter is used to count how many transactions are currently holding a **R-lock** over a resource. 
When the counter reaches 0, it means the resource is free.

#### Lock Manager
The schedules becomes thus a lock manager.
Whenever it receives a transaction request, it grants locks based on already granted ones.

##### Lock granting
If **lock request** is **granted**, then the corresponding resource is acquired by the requesting transaction and is freed when the transaction performs an **unlock**(upon committing or aborting).
However, if **lock request** is **not granted**, then the requesting transaction is put into a waiting state that ends when the resource is unlocked and becomes available.

##### Lock tables
The lock manager exploit a lock table to check whether a lock request can be granted or not.
![[lock_table.png]]
*Example of a conflict table used to check if lock can be granted or not
E.g: if I request a W-lock on a W-locked, then the request is not granted*

The **lock table** is stored in **main memory** and for each data objects, 2 bits are used to represent the 3 possible states(free,w-locked,r-locked) and a **counter** to count the number of waiting transactions on that data object

##### Serializability
2PL guarantees serializability.
A CSR however may not be serializable as 2PL has more restrictions on transactions.

##### Strict 2PL
Strict version of 2PL that prevents **dirty reading** by releasing locks **only** after the end of a transaction(commit/rollback).

#### Lock Manager Interface
The lock manager offers an interface to upper layers to acquire o release a lock:
- **R-lock(T,x,ErrorCode,Timeout)**
- **W-lock(T,x,ErrorCode,Timeout)**
- **UnLock(T,x)**
where
- **T** is the id of the transaction
- **x** is the resource being requested/released
- **ErrorCode** is the return parameter containing the result:
	- Ok: request satisfied
	- Not ok: request not satisfied
- **Timeout:** maximum time the transaction is willing to wait for the request to be granted
##### Locking policies
When a transaction requests a resource **x**, there can be two outcomes:
- Request **satisfied:** lock manager modifies the state of **x** in its internal tables and returns control to the transaction. The delay is very small
- Request **not satisfied:** transaction is put into a waiting queue.
	- When the resource becomes available, the lock is granted to the first transaction in the queue.
	- If **timeout** expires, transaction can either abort/restart or requests again the lock.

#### Hierarchical locking
Locks can be acquired at different granularity/scope level:
- table
- group of tuples(fragment)
	- physical partitioning
	- logical partitioning
- single tuple
- single field in a tuple

Hierarchical locking is an extension of traditional locking with a larget set of locking primitives:
- **Shared Lock(SL)**
- **eXclusive Lock(XL)**
- **Intention** of **SL** **(ISL)**: Intention of acquiring a **SL** on a finer granularity node
- **Intention** of **XL** **(IXL)**: Intention of acquiring a **XL** on a finer granularity node
- **SL** and **IXL**(**SIXL**): **SL** on the current node + **IXL** 

##### Request Protocol
1. Locks are always requested starting from the root and going down the tree(top-down approach)
2. Locks are always released from the blocked node up to the root (bottom-up approach)
3. To request a **SL** or **ISL** on a given node, a transaction must own **ISL** or **IXL** on its parent node in tree
4. To request a **XL**,**IXL** or **SIXL** on a given node a transaction must own an **IXL** or **SIXL** on its parent node in the tree
The following **compatibility matrix** is used when checking for granting requests:
![[comp_matrix.png]]

##### Selection of granularity
It depends on the type of application:
- **localized reads** or **few updates:** detailed granularity
- **massive reads/updates:** rough granularity
A coarse granularity reduces concurrency(if I lock the whole DB, there's no concurrency at all) while a finer granularity promotes concurrency but also forces a significant overhead on the lock manager

##### Predicate locking
It addresses the ghost update of type b (insert) anomaly. 
For 2PL a read operation is not in conflict with the insert of a new tuple:
the new tuple can’t be locked in advance

Predicate locking allows locking all data satisfying a given predicate. Used in In-real-time systems  by locking indices.

#### Locking in SQL2 standard
There are 2 transaction types:
- **Read-write(default**
- **Read-only**
For each transaction, we can specify the isolation level, that is, how it interacts with other executing transactions

##### Levels
- **Serializable:** highest level, makes other transactions serializable and includes also predicate locking
- **Repetable read:** Strict 2PL without predicate locking
- **Read committed:** Not 2PL, read lock is released as soon as the object is read. It avoids dirty read
- **Read uncomitted:** Not 2PL, data is read without acquiring lock. This level is allowed only for **read-only** transactions.

#### Deadlock
To prevent them, we can use:
- **Timeouts**
- **Pessimistic 2PL:** all locks needed are acquired before the transaction starts, not always feasible tho
- **Timestamp:** only younger transactions are allowed to wait, it may cause overkill tho
- **Wait graph:** nodes are transactions, edges represent a waiting state between two transactions. A cycle represents a deadlock. It's expensive to mantain
