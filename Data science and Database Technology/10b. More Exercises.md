Order of sequential selection doesn't matter apparently, they are performed together.
Since the PARTECIPATION has the foreign key, it drains the join: cartesian product 5\*10^2 and 3\*10^6 and then divide by divide by competition in database 10^5. Or axproximate by saying that i have a total 1/200 reduction factor in competition, and apply that to partecipations.
The real result would be 1.5\*10^4

Why didnt we put also BirthDate in the secondary hash index? Cause even though both combined give a 1/200 reduction factor, keeping an index with multiple attributes is really expensive.

For sport_association we can also create no index cause the table is small and can be fully loaded into memory nel chilling. (the one in the example is primary cause the key is ordered,being an auto increment key)
