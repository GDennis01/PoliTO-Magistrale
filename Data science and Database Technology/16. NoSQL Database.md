They are more dynamic and more flexible.
They are called like that due to an hashtag(kek) on twitter.
They have 3 main features:
- They require **no joins**, which are quite expensive
- They are **schema-less**, that is, they  have no tables. This provides a high degree of flexibility
- They are scalable **horizontally**. The advantages are quite obviously: you dont need to own a powerful PC.

## Types of NoSQL

### Key Values
They are the simplest ones.
Match keys with values, has great performance and it's easily scalable.
Examples of DB implementing this type are: **Redis**, **Riak**,**Memcached**Redis stores records in the RAM.
### Column oriented
Data are stored in a columnar format.

Examples of DB: Cassandra, AmazonDynamoDB etc

### Graph
Based on graph theory.
Mainly used on social medias where nodes are users and edges are the relations to other users.
They are thus used to store information about networks.
Examples of DB: Neo4j,OrientDB and Infinite Graph

### Document
Data stored in documents.
Each key is mapped to documents. 
A document has hierarchcial tree nested data structures, like maps and list.
**MongoDB** falls into this category, as well as **CouchDB** and RavenDB

## Distributed databases
Data is replicated through several servers.
There are 3 problems though:
- **Consistency:** All distributed databases must provide the same data to application
- **Availability:** Database failures do not prevent survivors node to continuing to operate
- **Partition tolerance:** The system continues to operate despite arbitrary message loss, when connectivity failures cause network partitions

### CAP Theorem
States that it's not possible to obtain all three properties
![[cap_triangle.png]]

#### CA (no P) - Local Consistency
Partitioning causes a failure in the system.

#### CP (no A) - Transaction Locking
Sometimes the system can *not answer* request at all

#### AP (no C) - Best effort
Each  part of the system makes available what it knows


#### BASE
- **Basically Available:** based on CAP theorem, the system provides availability
- **Soft state:** state of system may change over time, due to the eventual consistency model
- **Eventual consistency:** indicates that the system will become eventually stable, provided no input is received in that time
