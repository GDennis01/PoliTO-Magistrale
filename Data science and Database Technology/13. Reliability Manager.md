### Intro
It's responsible for the **Atomicity** and **Durability** **ACID** properties.
It implements the following transactional commands:
- **Begin Transaction(B)**, usually implicity
- **Commit Work(C)**
- **Rollback Work(A for abort)**
It also provides recovery primitives:
- **warm restart** for main memory failures
- **cold restart**
By interacting with the **buffer manager**, it manages the reliability of read/write requests: for this purpose it can also generate new requests.
It does so by exploiting a **log file**, a file stored in a ***stable memory***.
In case of data recovery, data is prepared through **checkpoints** or **dumps**.

### Stable memory
It's a memory that is resistant/robust to failure.
This can be achieved through redundancy and read/write protocols.
If there are failures in this kind of memory, it's considered a catastrophe(like an earthquake or smt like that)

### Log File
It's a *sequential* file written in **stable memory** that records transactions in a chronological order.
Log records can be either **System** or **Transactions**

#### Transaction Records
They describe activities performed by each transaction.
Each transaction is delimited by **Begin - B(T)** and either **Commit - C(T)** or **Abort - A(T)** where **T** is the transaction identifier.
Inside a transaction, there are *data modification* operations and they are stored in the log file based on the type:
- Insert **I(T,O,AS)**
- Delete **D(T,O,BS)**
- Update **U(T,O,BS,AS)**
where **O** is the written object(RID), **BS** represents the *state* before the operation and **AS** the state after the operation

#### System Records
These records log system operations such as saving data on disk(or other tertiary storage) and can be:
- **Dump:** copy of database
- **Checkpoint:** point in time where the database state is persistent on the storage

##### Undo/Redo actions
In case of failures, undo and redo actions must be performed in order to bring the database in a correct state.
These two operations are idempotent, which means that,no matter how many time we do them on the same action, the outcome will be the same.
*UNDO (UNDO(action)) = UNDO(action)*

##### Checkpoint
An operation periodically requested by the Reliability Manager to the Buffer Manager that allows a faster recovery process in case of a failure.
It's composed of three main steps:
1. TIDs of active transactions are recorded, and until the checkpoint operation is finished, no transaction can commit
2. Pages of concluded transactions(commit/abort) are *synchronously* written on the disk through the **force** primitive
3. At the end of step 2, a **checkpoint record** is **synchronously**(force primitive) written on the log file. It contains the set of active transactions.
After this operation, the effect of all concluded transactions is **permanently** stored on the disk. 

##### Dump
An operation that creates a copy of the database, typically performed when the system is offline.
The copy is stored in a **stable memory**.
At the end, a **dump record** is written on the log, containing **date-time** of the dump and **dump device** used

#### Writing Rules for the log
A set of rules that allows for recovery in case of failure.
These rules are both applied together when writing on the log.
For **data modifications/on commit**, the log is written **synchronously**.
For **abort/rollback**, the log is written **asynchronously**.

##### WAL - Write Ahead Log
The **BS - Before state** of data in a log record is actually written before the actual operation takes place.
Basically, first I write the **BS** record log on the stable memory and only then I proceed to perform the operation(writing the record) on the database.
In this way, we can **undo** data written on disk in case of failure

##### Commit precedence
The **AS - After state** of data in a log record is actually written before the commit operation takes place.
So first I write the **log record** in stable memory, and only then I proceed to **commit**.
In this way we can **redo** operations already **committed** but not yet written on the disk.

##### Commit Record
It represents a border line on the log file:
- **written on the log:** transaction should be *redone*
- **not written on the log:** transaction should be *undone*

### Recovery Management
There are two kinds of failures that can occur on a DBMS:
- **System failure:** caused by either software problems or PSU interruptions. It causes losing the **main memory** content (DBMS buffer) but not the disk (both database and log)
- **Media failure:** Caused by failure of devices managing secondary memory It causes losing the **database content** on disk, but not the log content (stored in stable storage)

In case of a failure, a **fail-stop** model is used:
![[fail_stop_model.png]]
1. System is **stopped**
2. Recovery procedure based on the failure
	- **Warm** restart for **system** failures
	- **Cold** restart for **media** failures
3. System becomes available again once the recovery ends.

#### Transaction Categories
There are three categories of transactions based on their status before/after the checkpoint:
- **completed:** completed(both committed and written on disk) before the checkpoint. In this case no action is needed for a recovery
- **committed:** committed but not yet,probably, written on the disk after the checkpoint. In this case a **redo** is needed
- **active:** active transactions(not yet committed) at the time of a failure. In this case an **undo** is needed.

 #### Warm Restart
 Recovery procedure applied in case of a **system failure**
 Two main steps:
 1. Read **backwards** the log until last checkpoint is found
 2. Detect transactions which should be **undone/redone**
	 - At the last checkpoint:
		 - **UNDO:** {Active transactions at checkpoint}
		 - **REDO:** {empty}
	 - Read forward the log:
		 - **UNDO:** Add all transactions for which the begin record is found(transactions started after the checkpoint)
		 - **REDO:** Move transactions from **UNDO** to **REDO** if a **commit** record is found (transactions that ended before failure).
			 - Transactions ending with rollback remain in the UNDO list
3. **Data recovery:** Log is read backwards(again) from the failure until the oldest transaction in **UNDO/REDO** list. Here transactions are either undone or redone.

At the end of **step 2**, a list of transactions to be **undone** and **redone** is produced.
### Cold Restart
Recovery procedure in case of failures on the database on the disk.
Three main steps:
1. Access the last **dump** to restore the damaged (portion of) the disk
2. Starting from the last dump record, read the log **forward** and redo all actions on the database and transaction commit/rollback
3. Perform a warm restart.

Alternatively to steps **2 and 3**, only committed transactions can be processed:
- Detect **committed** transactions(to build a **REDO** list)
- **Redo** actions of transactions in REDO list.
